    summary:
      "Alaska ( (listen); Aleut: Alax̂sxax̂; Inupiaq: Alaasikaq; Alutiiq: Alas'kaaq; Tlingit: Anáaski; Russian: Аляска\\, romanized: Alyaska) is a U.S. state in the northwest extremity of the United States West Coast\\, just across the Bering Strait from Asia. The Canadian province of British Columbia and territory of Yukon border the state to the east and southeast. Its most extreme western part is Attu Island\\, and it has a maritime border with Russia (Chukotka Autonomous Okrug) to the west across the Bering Strait. To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort seas—southern parts of the Arctic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest. It is the largest U.S. state by area and the seventh largest subnational division in the world. In addition\\, it is the 3rd least populous and the most sparsely populated of the 50 United States; nevertheless\\, it is by far the most populous territory located mostly north of the 60th parallel in North America: its population—estimated at 738\\,432 by the United States Census Bureau in 2015—is more than quadruple the combined populations of Northern Canada and Greenland. Approximately half of Alaska's residents live within the Anchorage metropolitan area. Alaska's economy is dominated by the fishing\\, natural gas\\, and oil industries\\, resources which it has in abundance. United States armed forces bases and tourism are also a significant part of the economy.\\nOn March 30\\, 1867\\, the United States purchased Alaska from the Russian Empire for 7.2 million U.S. dollars\\, or  approximately two cents per acre ($4.74/km2). The area went through several administrative changes before becoming organized as a territory on May 11\\, 1912. It was admitted as the 49th state of the U.S. on January 3\\, 1959.",

      "Arizona ( (listen); Navajo: Hoozdo Hahoodzo Navajo pronunciation: [xòːztò xɑ̀xòːtsò]; O'odham: Alĭ ṣonak Uto-Aztecan pronunciation: [ˡaɺi ˡʂonak]) is a state in the southwestern region of the United States. It is also part of the Western and the Mountain states. It is the sixth largest and the 14th most populous of the 50 states. Its capital and largest city is Phoenix. Arizona shares the Four Corners region with Utah\\, Colorado\\, and New Mexico; its other neighboring states are Nevada and California to the west and the Mexican states of Sonora and Baja California to the south and southwest.\\nArizona is the 48th state and last of the contiguous states to be admitted to the Union\\, achieving statehood on February 14\\, 1912\\, coinciding with Valentine's Day. Historically part of the territory of Alta California in New Spain\\, it became part of independent Mexico in 1821. After being defeated in the Mexican–American War\\, Mexico ceded much of this territory to the United States in 1848. The southernmost portion of the state was acquired in 1853 through the Gadsden Purchase.\\nSouthern Arizona is known for its desert climate\\, with very hot summers and mild winters. Northern Arizona features forests of pine\\, Douglas fir\\, and spruce trees; the Colorado Plateau; mountain ranges (such as the San Francisco Mountains); as well as large\\, deep canyons\\, with much more moderate summer temperatures and significant winter snowfalls. There are ski resorts in the areas of Flagstaff\\, Alpine\\, and Tucson. In addition to the Grand Canyon National Park\\, there are several national forests\\, national parks\\, and national monuments.\\nAbout one-quarter of the state is made up of Indian reservations that serve as the home of 27 federally recognized Native American tribes\\, including the Navajo Nation\\, the largest in the state and the United States\\, with more than 300\\,000 citizens. Although federal law gave all Native Americans the right to vote in 1924\\, Arizona excluded those living on reservations in the state from voting until the state Supreme Court ruled in favor of Native American plaintiffs in Trujillo v. Garley (1948).",
