In 1861\\\\\\\\, Arkansas seceded from the United States and joined the Confederate States of America during the Civil War.\\\\nOn returning to the Union in 1868\\\\\\\\, the state continued to suffer due to its reliance on the large-scale plantation economy. Cotton continued as the leading commodity crop\\\\\\\\, although the cotton market declined. Because farmers and businessmen did not diversify and there was little industrial investment\\\\\\\\, the state fell behind in terms of its economy and opportunities for residents.\\\\nWhite rural interests dominated the state's politics by disenfranchisement of African Americans and by refusal to reapportion the legislature. It was not until after the civil rights movement and passage of federal legislation that more African Americans were able to vote. The Supreme Court overturned rural domination in the South and other states that had refused to reapportion their state legislatures\\\\\\\\, or retained rules based on geographic districts. In one man\\\\\\\\, one vote\\\\\\\\, it ruled that states had to organize both houses of their legislatures by districts that held approximately equal populations\\\\\\\\, and that these had to be redefined as necessary after each decade's census.\\\\nFollowing World War II\\\\\\\\, Arkansas began to diversity its economy.

Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison.\\\\nKansas was first settled by Americans in 1827 with the establishment of Fort Leavenworth. The pace of settlement accelerated in the 1850s\\\\\\\\, in the midst of political wars over the slavery debate. When it was officially opened to settlement by the U.S. government in 1854 with the Kansas–Nebraska Act\\\\\\\\, abolitionist Free-Staters from New England and pro-slavery settlers from neighboring Missouri rushed to the territory to determine whether Kansas would become a free state or a slave state. Thus\\\\\\\\, the area was a hotbed of violence and chaos in its early days as these forces collided\\\\\\\\, and was known as Bleeding Kansas. The abolitionists prevailed\\\\\\\\, and on January 29\\\\\\\\, 1861\\\\\\\\, Kansas entered the Union as a free state\\\\\\\\, hence the unofficial nickname The Free State.\\\\nBy 2015\\\\\\\\, Kansas was one of the most productive agricultural states\\\\\\\\, producing high yields of wheat\\\\\\\\, corn\\\\\\\\, sorghum\\\\\\\\, and soybeans.

The state's largest city is Baltimore\\\\\\\\, and its capital is Annapolis. Among its occasional nicknames are Old Line State\\\\\\\\, the Free State\\\\\\\\, and the Chesapeake Bay State. It is named after the English queen Henrietta Maria\\\\\\\\, known in England as Queen Mary\\\\\\\\, who was the wife of King Charles I.Sixteen of Maryland's twenty-three counties\\\\\\\\, as well as the city of Baltimore\\\\\\\\, border the tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay estuary and its many tributaries\\\\\\\\, which combined total more than 4\\\\\\\\,000 miles of shoreline. Although one of the smallest states in the U.S.\\\\\\\\, it features a variety of climates and topographical features that have earned it the moniker of America in Miniature. In a similar vein\\\\\\\\, Maryland's geography\\\\\\\\, culture\\\\\\\\, and history combines elements of the Mid-Atlantic\\\\\\\\, Northeastern\\\\\\\\, and South Atlantic regions of the country.\\\\nBefore its coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century\\\\\\\\, Maryland was inhabited by several groups of Native Americans\\\\\\\\, mostly by the Algonquin\\\\\\\\, and to a lesser degree by the Iroquois and Sioux. As one of the original Thirteen Colonies of Great Britain\\\\\\\\, Maryland was founded by George Calvert\\\\\\\\, a Catholic convert who sought to provide a religious haven for Catholics persecuted in England. In 1632\\\\\\\\, Charles I of England granted Calvert a colonial charter\\\\\\\\, naming the colony after his wife\\\\\\\\, Queen Mary (Henrietta Maria of France). Unlike the Pilgrims and Puritans\\\\\\\\, who rejected Popishness in their settlements\\\\\\\\, Calvert envisioned a colony where people of different religious sects would coexist under the principle of toleration. Accordingly\\\\\\\\, in 1649 the Maryland General Assembly passed an Act Concerning Religion\\\\\\\\, which enshrined this principle by penalizing anyone who reproached a fellow Marylander based on religious affiliation. Nevertheless\\\\\\\\, religious strife was common in the early years\\\\\\\\, and Catholics remained a minority\\\\\\\\, albeit in greater numbers than in any other English colony.\\\\nMaryland's early settlements and population centers clustered around rivers and other waterways that empty into the Chesapeake Bay. Its economy was heavily plantation-based\\\\\\\\, centered mostly on the cultivation of tobacco. The need for cheap labor led to a rapid expansion of indentured servants\\\\\\\\, penal labor\\\\\\\\, and African slaves. In 1760\\\\\\\\, Maryland's current boundaries took form following the settlement of a long-running border dispute with Pennsylvania. Maryland was an active participant in the events leading up to the American Revolution\\\\\\\\, and by 1776 its delegates signed the Declaration of Independence. Many of its citizens subsequently played key political and military roles in the war. In 1790\\\\\\\\, the state ceded land for the establishment of the U.S. capital of Washington\\\\\\\\, D.C.\\\\nAlthough then a slave state\\\\\\\\, Maryland remained in the Union during the American Civil War\\\\\\\\, its strategic location giving it a significant role in the conflict. After the war\\\\\\\\, Maryland took part in the Industrial Revolution\\\\\\\\, driven by its seaports\\\\\\\\, railroad networks\\\\\\\\, and mass immigration from Europe. Since the Second World War\\\\\\\\, the state's population has grown rapidly\\\\\\\\, to approximately six million residents\\\\\\\\, and it is among the most densely populated U.S. states.

The area formed part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain\\\\\\\\, and became part of Mexico when it gained independence in 1821. The United States annexed the area in 1848 after its victory in the Mexican–American War\\\\\\\\, and it was incorporated as part of Utah Territory in 1850. The discovery of silver at the Comstock Lode in 1859 led to a population boom that became an impetus to the creation of Nevada Territory out of western Utah Territory in 1861.

This sharply reduced competition in politics in the state until after passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-20th century.

In 1632\\\\\\\\, Charles I of England granted Calvert a colonial charter\\\\\\\\, naming the colony after his wife\\\\\\\\, Queen Mary (Henrietta Maria of France). Unlike the Pilgrims and Puritans\\\\\\\\, who rejected Popishness in their settlements\\\\\\\\, Calvert envisioned a colony where people of different religious sects would coexist under the principle of toleration. Accordingly\\\\\\\\, in 1649 the Maryland General Assembly passed an Act Concerning Religion\\\\\\\\, which enshrined this principle by penalizing anyone who reproached a fellow Marylander based on religious affiliation. Nevertheless\\\\\\\\, religious strife was common in the early years\\\\\\\\, and Catholics remained a minority\\\\\\\\, albeit in greater numbers than in any other English colony.\\\\nMaryland's early settlements and population centers clustered around rivers and other waterways that empty into the Chesapeake Bay. Its economy was heavily plantation-based\\\\\\\\, centered mostly on the cultivation of tobacco. The need for cheap labor led to a rapid expansion of indentured servants\\\\\\\\, penal labor\\\\\\\\, and African slaves. In 1760\\\\\\\\, Maryland's current boundaries took form following the settlement of a long-running border dispute with Pennsylvania. Maryland was an active participant in the events leading up to the American Revolution\\\\\\\\, and by 1776 its delegates signed the Declaration of Independence.
