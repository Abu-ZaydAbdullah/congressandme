The history of agriculture began thousands of years ago. After gathering wild grains beginning at least 105,000 years ago, nascent farmers began to plant them around 11,500 years ago. Pigs, sheep and cattle were domesticated over 10,000 years ago. Plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world. Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture in the twentieth century came to dominate agricultural output, though about 2 billion people still depended on subsistence agriculture into the twenty-first.\",description:\"Food \",image:\"https://gitlab.com/auproxis/images/raw/master/farming.jpg\",issue_id:2,name:\"Agriculture\",vids:\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qmla9NLFBvU\"},{abbreviation:\"armed_forces\",about:\"The United States Armed Forces are the military forces of the United States of America.

All five armed services are among the seven uniformed services of the United States. From the time of its inception, the U.S. Armed Forces played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the founders of the United States were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played a critical role in the American Civil War, continuing to serve as the armed forces of the United States, although a number of its officers resigned to join the military of the Confederate States. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework. The Act established the National Military Establishment, headed by the secretary of defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and the National Security Council. It was amended in 1949, renaming the National Military Establishment the Department of Defense, and merged the cabinet-level Department of the Army, Department of the Navy, and Department of the Air Force, into the Department of Defense.\",description:\"Warfare \",image:\"https://gitlab.com/auproxis/images/raw/master/armed-forces.jpg\",issue_id:3,name:\"Armed Forces\",vids:\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPkr7ZqhCV0\"},{abbreviation:\"crimes\",about:'In ordinary language, a crime is an unlawful act punishable by a state or other authority.[1] The term \"crime\" does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition,[2] though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes.[3] The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law.[2] One proposed definition is that a crime or offence (or criminal offence) is an act harmful not only to some individual but also to a community, society, or the state (\"a public wrong\"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.

Pigs, sheep and cattle were domesticated over 10,000 years ago. Plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world.

A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the founders of the United States were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played a critical role in the American Civil War, continuing to serve as the armed forces of the United States, although a number of its officers resigned to join the military of the Confederate States. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework. The Act established the National Military Establishment, headed by the secretary of defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and the National Security Council. It was amended in 1949, renaming the National Military Establishment the Department of Defense, and merged the cabinet-level Department of the Army, Department of the Navy, and Department of the Air Force, into the Department of Defense.\",\n    description: \"Warfare \",\n    image: \"https://gitlab.com/auproxis/images/raw/master/armed-forces.jpg\",\n    issue_id: 3,\n    name: \"Armed Forces\",\n    vids: \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPkr7ZqhCV0\"\n  },\n  {\n    abbreviation: \"crimes\",\n    about:\n      'In ordinary language, a crime is an unlawful act punishable by a state or other authority.[1] The term \"crime\" does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition,[2] though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes.[3] The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law.[2] One proposed definition is that a crime or offence (or criminal offence) is an act harmful not only to some individual but also to a community, society, or the state (\"a public wrong\").

Emergency management is a related term but should not be equated to disaster management.\",\n    description: \"First-Responders  \",\n    image: \"https://gitlab.com/auproxis/images/raw/master/emergency.jpg\",\n    issue_id: 7,\n    name: \"Emergency Management\",\n    vids: \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00OoD3_aemQ\"\n  },\n  {\n    abbreviation: \"environmentalism\",\n    about:\n      \"Every day, the earth crawls closer to irreversible catastrophe thanks to our own actions.
