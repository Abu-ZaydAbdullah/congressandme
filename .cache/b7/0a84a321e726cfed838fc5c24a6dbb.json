Following increased commercial activity in the Great Lakes after the construction of the Erie Canal\\\\\\\\, Chicago was founded in the 1830s on the banks of the Chicago River at one of the few natural harbors on the southern section of Lake Michigan. John Deere's invention of the self-scouring steel plow turned Illinois's rich prairie into some of the world's most productive and valuable farmland\\\\\\\\, attracting immigrant farmers from Germany and Sweden. The Illinois and Michigan Canal (1848) made transportation between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River valley faster and cheaper\\\\\\\\, and new railroads carried immigrants to new homes in the country's west and shipped commodity crops to the nation's east. The state became a transportation hub for the nation.By 1900\\\\\\\\, the growth of industrial jobs in the northern cities and coal mining in the central and southern areas attracted immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe. Illinois was an important manufacturing center during both world wars. The Great Migration from the South established a large community of African Americans in the state\\\\\\\\, including Chicago\\\\\\\\, who founded the city's famous jazz and blues cultures. Chicago\\\\\\\\, the center of the Chicago Metropolitan Area\\\\\\\\, is now recognized as a global alpha-level city.\\\\nThree U.S. presidents have been elected while living in Illinois: Abraham Lincoln\\\\\\\\, Ulysses S. Grant\\\\\\\\, and Barack Obama. Additionally\\\\\\\\, Ronald Reagan\\\\\\\\, whose political career was based in California\\\\\\\\, was born and raised in the state. Today\\\\\\\\, Illinois honors Lincoln with its official state slogan Land of Lincoln\\\\\\\\, which has been displayed on its license plates since 1954.

Unlike the Pilgrims and Puritans\\\\\\\\, who rejected Popishness in their settlements\\\\\\\\, Calvert envisioned a colony where people of different religious sects would coexist under the principle of toleration. Accordingly\\\\\\\\, in 1649 the Maryland General Assembly passed an Act Concerning Religion\\\\\\\\, which enshrined this principle by penalizing anyone who reproached a fellow Marylander based on religious affiliation.

The need for cheap labor led to a rapid expansion of indentured servants\\\\\\\\, penal labor\\\\\\\\, and African slaves. In 1760\\\\\\\\, Maryland's current boundaries took form following the settlement of a long-running border dispute with Pennsylvania. Maryland was an active participant in the events leading up to the American Revolution\\\\\\\\, and by 1776 its delegates signed the Declaration of Independence.

Missouri is bordered by eight states (tied for the most with Tennessee): Iowa to the north\\\\\\\\, Illinois\\\\\\\\, Kentucky and Tennessee (via the Mississippi River) to the east\\\\\\\\, Arkansas to the south and Oklahoma\\\\\\\\, Kansas and Nebraska to the west. In the South are the Ozarks\\\\\\\\, a forested highland\\\\\\\\, providing timber\\\\\\\\, minerals and recreation. The Missouri River\\\\\\\\, after which the state is named\\\\\\\\, flows through the center of the state into the Mississippi River\\\\\\\\, which makes up Missouri's eastern border.\\\\nHumans have inhabited the land now known as Missouri for at least 12\\\\\\\\,000 years. The Mississippian culture built cities and mounds\\\\\\\\, before declining in the 14th century. When European explorers arrived in the 17th century\\\\\\\\, they encountered the Osage and Missouria nations. The French established Louisiana\\\\\\\\, a part of New France\\\\\\\\, founding Ste. Genevieve in 1735 and St. Louis in 1764. After a brief period of Spanish rule\\\\\\\\, the United States acquired the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Americans from the Upland South\\\\\\\\, including enslaved African Americans\\\\\\\\, rushed into the new Missouri Territory. Missouri was admitted as a slave state as part of the Missouri Compromise. Many from Virginia\\\\\\\\, Kentucky and Tennessee settled in the Boonslick area of Mid-Missouri. Soon after\\\\\\\\, heavy German immigration formed the Missouri Rhineland.\\\\nMissouri played a central role in the westward expansion of the United States\\\\\\\\, as memorialized by the Gateway Arch. The Pony Express\\\\\\\\, Oregon Trail\\\\\\\\, Santa Fe Trail and California Trail all began in Missouri. As a border state\\\\\\\\, Missouri's role in the American Civil War was complex and there were many conflicts within. After the war\\\\\\\\, both Greater St. Louis and the Kansas City metropolitan area became centers of industrialization and business. Today\\\\\\\\, the state is divided into 114 counties and the independent city of St. Louis.\\\\nMissouri's culture blends elements from the Midwestern and Southern United States. The musical styles of ragtime\\\\\\\\, Kansas City jazz and St. Louis blues developed in Missouri. The well-known Kansas City-style barbecue and lesser-known St. Louis-style barbecue\\\\\\\\, can be found across the state and beyond. Missouri is also a major center of beer brewing; Anheuser-Busch is the largest producer in the world. Missouri wine is produced in the Missouri Rhineland and Ozarks. Missouri's alcohol laws are among the most permissive in the United States. Outside of the state's major cities\\\\\\\\, popular tourist destinations include the Lake of the Ozarks\\\\\\\\, Table Rock Lake and Branson.\\\\nWell-known Missourians include Harry S. Truman\\\\\\\\, Edwin Hubble\\\\\\\\, Mark Twain\\\\\\\\, Walt Disney\\\\\\\\, Chuck Berry\\\\\\\\, Sheryl Crow\\\\\\\\, Brad Pitt and Nelly. Some of the largest companies based in the state include Cerner\\\\\\\\, Express Scripts\\\\\\\\, Monsanto\\\\\\\\, Emerson Electric\\\\\\\\, Edward Jones\\\\\\\\, H&R Block\\\\\\\\, Wells Fargo Advisors and O'Reilly Auto Parts. Universities in Missouri include the University of Missouri and the top ranked Washington University in St. Louis.

In 1632\\\\\\\\, Charles I of England granted Calvert a colonial charter\\\\\\\\, naming the colony after his wife\\\\\\\\, Queen Mary (Henrietta Maria of France). Unlike the Pilgrims and Puritans\\\\\\\\, who rejected Popishness in their settlements\\\\\\\\, Calvert envisioned a colony where people of different religious sects would coexist under the principle of toleration. Accordingly\\\\\\\\, in 1649 the Maryland General Assembly passed an Act Concerning Religion\\\\\\\\, which enshrined this principle by penalizing anyone who reproached a fellow Marylander based on religious affiliation. Nevertheless\\\\\\\\, religious strife was common in the early years\\\\\\\\, and Catholics remained a minority\\\\\\\\, albeit in greater numbers than in any other English colony.\\\\nMaryland's early settlements and population centers clustered around rivers and other waterways that empty into the Chesapeake Bay.

The need for cheap labor led to a rapid expansion of indentured servants\\\\\\\\, penal labor\\\\\\\\, and African slaves. In 1760\\\\\\\\, Maryland's current boundaries took form following the settlement of a long-running border dispute with Pennsylvania. Maryland was an active participant in the events leading up to the American Revolution\\\\\\\\, and by 1776 its delegates signed the Declaration of Independence.
